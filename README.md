<h2>Description</h2>
This product is both a side table and an air purifier that improves indoor air quality. The air purifier detects particles (PM2.5) in the air, allowing you to adjust the fan speed, so you can focus on other things. It ensures the efficient removal of harmful allergens like tobacco smoke, dust, and pollen. You can adjust the fan speed and check the current air quality status easily. You can also sleep with the air purifier on since it is very quiet at lower fan speeds. The cable is hidden inside the leg, giving it a clean look and avoiding cable clutter. This product has three speed settings: pressing the button once turns on one LED light for low speed, pressing it twice turns on two LED lights for medium speed, and pressing it three times turns on three LED lights for high speed. Additionally, there are two other indicator lights above the speed lights. A red light indicates harmful air when the sensor detects poor air quality, and a blue light indicates clean air when the sensor reads good air quality.
